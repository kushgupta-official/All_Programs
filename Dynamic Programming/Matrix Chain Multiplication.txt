Matrix Chain Multiplication Basic Format:-

int solve(int arr[], int i, int j){

/* For a recursive function first will a come base condition, in mcm the 
	base condition will be for an invalid input.
*/
	if (i>j){		//here not necessary i>j it is dependent on question
		return 0;
	}

	for (k=i;k<j;k++){		// here k iteration will depend on question 						// such that it satisfies what the question 						// says
		/*Now calculate temporary answer for each like this :
		*/

		temp_ans=solve(arr,i,k)+solve(arr,k+1,j)+(anything else maybe 												possible)

		/*Now, main answer will be calculated by calling a function on temp_ans's like min, max or anything else depending on questions
		*/

		ans<-function(temp_ans)
	}
	return ans;
}


Steps for solving MCM : 
		1. Find what the i and j would be understanding the question
		2. Determine Base Condition
		3. Find k loop scheme
		4. calculate main answer from temporary answer.
